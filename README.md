# C++ One-Thread-One-Loop Concurrent Server Implementation
C++ - Implementation of One-Thread-One-Loop Concurrent Server Using Muduo-like Library


This project implements a high-concurrency server using the "One-Thread-One-Loop" model, inspired by the Muduo library. The server is designed to handle multiple client requests concurrently using a single thread and a single event loop, following the Reactor pattern.

## Features
- **One-Thread-One-Loop Model**: Each thread handles a single event loop, improving efficiency and simplifying concurrency.
- **Reactor Pattern**: The server uses the Reactor pattern to manage asynchronous I/O operations.
- **High Concurrency**: Optimized for handling many concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
- **Muduo-like Implementation**: Built upon concepts similar to the Muduo library, providing an efficient and scalable design for high-performance networking applications.

## Requirements
- **C++11 or later**: This project uses features of C++11 and above.
- **Linux-based System**: Recommended for running this server due to its reliance on Linux-specific APIs for event handling.
